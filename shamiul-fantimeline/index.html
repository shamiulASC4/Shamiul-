            <h2> Early Life </h2>
            <p1> Lionel Andrés Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory
                manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side,
                he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from Marche and Catalonia, and on
                his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[2] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family,
                "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo
                and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[6]
                At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest
                influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[7]
                He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic,
                he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.[8][9]</p1>

                <h3> Barcelona </h3>
                <header> Rise to the first team: 2003-2005 </header>
                <p2>During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks,
                    debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in
                    four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with
                    the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[25][26]
                    Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the
                    international break. French Winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training
                    session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the
                    place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past
                    four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."[27]
                    At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, he made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute
                    during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[16][28] His performance, creating
                    two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily
                    with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[29] After his first
                    training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that
                    he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[30] Ronaldinho soon befriended
                    Messi, whom he called "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.
                </p2>
                <header> 2005-08: Making the Starting Eleven
                </header>
                <p3> On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him
                    a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased
                    to €150 million.[34] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy,
                    Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance
                    against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[42] While Capello requested
                    to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, who were willing to pay his buyout clause and
                    triple his wages. According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real
                    risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[43] On 16 September, his contract was updated
                    for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[34][44] </p3>
                <header> 2012: A record Breaking Year </header>
                <p4> As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break
                    several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against
                    Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an
                    unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[119][120] In addition to being the joint
                    top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's
                    record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top
                    scorer in four campaigns.[121][122] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in
                    Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with
                    a hat-trick against Granada.[118] </p4>
                <header> 2014-2015 </header>
                <p5> Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15
                    season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[166] A hat-trick
                    scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the
                    59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[167] Three days later, he scored another hat-trick
                    against APOEL, overtaking Raúl's 71 goals to become top scorer in the history of the Champions League.[168]
                    A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez
                    as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[169] Messi again placed second in the
                    FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina
                    at the World Cup.[170] At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing
                    end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point
                    came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident
                    of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed "MSN", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly
                    successful run.[171][172] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned
                    to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez,
                    their striker.[172][173] From there, he regained his best – arguably his best-ever – form, while Suárez
                    and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[174][175] With 58 goals from Messi,
                    the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[176][177]
                </p5>
                <header> 2016-2017 </header>
                <p6> Messi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona's captain in the absence
                    of the injured Andrés Iniesta;[214] he set-up Munir's goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first
                    leg on 14 August,[215] and subsequently scored and assisted in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August.[216]
                    Three days later, he scored two goals and provided an assist to lead Barcelona to a 6–2 victory against
                    Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season.[217] On 13 September 2016, Messi scored
                    his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign against
                    Celtic in a 7–0 victory; this was also Messi's sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any
                    player.[218] A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1–1 draw against Atlético Madrid and was
                    ruled out with injury for three weeks.[219] He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after
                    coming off the bench in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña, on 16 October.[220] Three days after
                    this, he netted his seventh Champions League hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4–0.[221]
                    On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona's 3–1 away return
                    fixture to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Raúl.[222] On 12 November,
                    Messi placed second in the 2016 Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who claimed the award for the fourth
                    time.[223] He finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe's top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimović.[224]
                    After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place –
                    behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again – in the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award.[225] On 11 January, Messi
                    scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round
                    of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition;
                    with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time
                    record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman.[226] In his next league match, on 14 January,
                    Messi scored in a 5–0 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Raúl's record for the most
                    number of teams scored against in La Liga (35).[227] On 4 February, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for
                    Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time
                    top-scorer from free-kicks.[228] On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid.
                    His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.[229] On 27 May, Messi scored a goal
                    and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey Final, helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory
                    over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match. In total, Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals
                    and 16 assists, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot
                    Awards for the fourth time in his career.[230][231]
                    <header> 2017-2018 </header>
                    <p6> On 5 July, 2017, Messi signed a new contract with Barcelona, keeping him at the club until 2021.

                <div class="profile">
                    <h4> Player Profile
                        <h4>
                            <p7> Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives
                                him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[331][332]
                                this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").[333][334][335]
                                Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which,
                                combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical
                                challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport
                                rife with playacting.[11][332][336] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts
                                of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling
                                at speed.[337] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only
                                player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."[38] Although he has improved
                                his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed
                                player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses
                                the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.
                            </p7>
